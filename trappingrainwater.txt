In this problem the height of different bars are to be given in an array(say h[] of length n). We have to find how many units of water does it accomodate.

A block can hold water if there are high bars on its left and right side . The amount of water can be found by finding the height of bars on left and right side. Total amount of water is the summation of all units of water.

1. For this we form two auxiliary arrays , of length n, which are left and right.
2. In left array , we store first element as left[0]=h[0], then we iterate from 1to n and store the maximum between left[i-1] and h[i].
3. In right array, we store last element as right[n-1]=h[n-1], then we iterate from n-2 down to 0 and store the maximmum between right[i+1] and h[i].
4. in this step we apply formula to get total ammount of water as:
  We iterate from 0to n and store as:
  ans+ = Math.min(left[i],right[i])-h[i];
5. the answer stores the summation of all units of water.. return ans.
